## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED & RESOLVED

### **Issue:** Missing Share Purchase Records
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** 11 approved payments had no corresponding share purchase records

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
The payment approval process was creating commission records but failing to create the corresponding share purchase records in the `aureus_share_purchases` table. This created a data integrity issue where:
- Payments were marked as approved
- Commissions were calculated and paid
- But users had no share purchase records in their portfolios

### **Resolution Implemented:**
1. **Created missing share purchase records** for all 11 payments
2. **Linked payments to share purchases** via investment_id
3. **Updated phase shares_sold count** (+2,785 shares)
4. **Verified data integrity** across all related tables

### **Records Created:**
```
‚úÖ 11 share purchase records created
‚úÖ 11 payment-to-purchase links established  
‚úÖ Phase shares_sold count updated
‚úÖ All data integrity constraints satisfied
```
